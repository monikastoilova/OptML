## Comparison of optimization algorithms for image classification

This project investigates the performance of the optimization algorithms SGD, SGD with momentum, ADAM and Lion on an image classification task using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The repository containes the files dataset.py and model.py allowing the implementation of the CNN structure and the use of the popular dataset MNIST, as well as a jupyter notebook file OptML_project.ipynb, where we run our main code and obtain the results described in the report.pdf.

### Content: 

As we mentioned, our goal is to compare SGD, SGD with momentum, ADAM and Lion optimizers. The study initially presents an examination of the strctures of the different optimization methods, including their respective pseudo-codes. It explores the roles of the hyperparameters and their importance during the training phase, and explaines the fundamental concept behind each step. Furthermore, the paper gives a detailed description of the structure of the model and the hyperparameters used for the resullts. Finally, the numerical results are presented (The .png files in this repository), accompanied by an insightful analysis of the plots, which enables a comprehensive comparison of the performances of the algorithms.

Additionally, further experiments are presented in the Appendix. Another type of Lion optimization algorithm is as well described. This approach introduced for the first time in 2015, draws inspiration from the evolution of lion populations in nature.
