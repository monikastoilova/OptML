# Project in CS-439 : Optimization for Machine Learning - EPFL course

## Comparison of optimization algorithms for image classification

This project investigates the performance of the optimization algorithms SGD, SGD with momentum, ADAM and Lion on an image classification task using convolutional neural networks (CNN). The repository containes the files dataset.py and model.py allowing the implementation of the CNN structure and the use of the popular dataset MNIST, as well as a jupyter notebook OptML_project.ipynb where we run our main code and obtain the results described in the report.pdf
